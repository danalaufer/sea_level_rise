# Time Series Analysis of the Gulf of Mexico Sea Level
In this study, I address the pressing issue of sea level rise, focusing specifically on the Gulf
of Mexico. First, I identify an appropriate SARIMA time series model to represent monthly
data from 1993 to 2020 of the average sea level of the Gulf of Mexico. Next, I use this model
to forecast the sea level ten years ahead and plot the predicted values along with their 
prediction intervals, pictured below.

As can be seen from the graph, the sea level in the Gulf of Mexico is estimated to increase by over 3 inches based
on the time series model I fit.
